# ✨About Me✨
Programming and computers always interested me - been using computers since early childhood.

- Completed 172 rooms on [<span style="color:hotpink">TryHackMe</span>](https://tryhackme.com/p/13th42) - Top 5,000 rank. Gained hands-on exp in pen testing, vuln analysis, forensics, cryptography & more.
- Grasped many concepts & languages, though suffering from lack of appropriate project ideas.
- Was trained in the underground dojos of [<span style="color:hotpink">Google-fu</span>](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=google-fu).
- Followed developments in AI closely *(technical to some degree)* since [<span style="color:hotpink">GPT-3</span>](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models)'s release, utilised used models like [<span style="color:hotpink">GPT-3.5</span>](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models), [<span style="color:hotpink">GPT-4</span>](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) and many more [<span style="color:hotpink">open source models</span>](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard) along with some spice in prompt engineering.
