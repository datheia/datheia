# ✨About Me✨
Programming and computers always interested me - been using computers since early childhood.

- Completed 172 rooms on [<span style="color:hotpink">TryHackMe</span>](https://tryhackme.com/p/13th42) - Top 5,000 rank. Gained hands-on exp in pen testing, vuln analysis, forensics, cryptography & more.
- Grasped many concepts & languages, though suffering from lack of appropriate project ideas.
- Was trained in the underground dojos of Google-fu.
- Followed developments in AI closely *(technical to some degree)* since GPT-3's release, utilised used models like GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and many more open source models along with some spice in prompt engineering.
